            <p><em>This post was written in response to the following writing prompt from reddit:</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8s0t2k/wp_after_paris_was_razed_by_an_alien_weapon_the/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After Paris was razed by an alien weapon the world awaits the imminent invasion. What humanity doesn’t know is that it was just a stray shot of a war fought millenia ago</a></p>
<p>Many historians suspect to this day that a third world war would have erupted on October 17th 2021, or shortly thereafter. Tensions were high, as trade wars had been waging between the worlds superpowers for some time, and a few of them were starting to realize that a war of trade would not get them all that they wanted. A summit had been called for the leaders of the world to meet in Paris on that day, in order to discuss the situation and hopefully back down from the brink of mutual destruction. But the third world war never started, and not because the summit was a success. Rather it was because of the opposite, for that was the day that thunder struck Paris. Some call it the shot that was <em>actually</em> heard around the world.</p>
<p>We still don’t know who fired at us, but what scientists were able to determine that a 20 kilogram projectile had fallen on the city at a speed of 1% - 1.3% of the speed of light. The weapon was not a nuke, however it struck with enough force to cause an explosion three times more devastating than the nuclear explosion over Hiroshima at the end of World War II. Three things were made clear to all of humanity that day: we are not alone, whoever is out there has better guns than us, and those guns are pointed in our direction.</p>
<p>World leader’s stopped meeting in person after that, for it was clear the enemy was looking for chances to destabilize the Earth’s governments. However despite this, international cooperation reached an all time high. Threat of imminent destruction is apparently a good motivator for working together. China and India immediately began developing an early warning system. As long as the enemy’s weapon traveled slower than light, it could be detected <em>before</em> impact. In tandem, the US and Russia began working on railguns of our own. Yes, for firing back at our as yet unseen enemies, but also we developed guns that could be targeted and fired quickly enough to intercept an incoming round in the time between its detection at the edge of our solar system and its impact on Earth.</p>
<p>For decades humanity continued its rapid advance in space faring tech, united by the terror imposed by one precision strike from a relativistic weapon. As soon as we were able, we started sending people to live in other star systems, for the best way for a species to survive a planet busting weapon is to not live entirely on one planet. And as the centuries wore on, interstellar travel became normal. The human race spread like wildfire to every habitable world they could find.</p>
<p>Yet not once, in all of this time preparing for the fight of their lives, did the human race encounter another hint of the enemy that struck them so long ago. All this progress, and all of humanity’s preparation for war did not come without doubts. There were always those who questioned: Why didn’t the attackers follow up when they had such a clear advantage? What advantage could possibly be gained by destroying one city and then leaving? After all these years of searching for the bastards that knocked us down, why haven’t we been able to even hear a hint of radio signal from them?</p>
<p>Some factions began to form and jockey for power in the Human Galactic Empire. Some believed that the invading force had been eliminated by some benevolent protector, as yet unseen simply because they did not wish to be. Others were of the opinion that the attack had been a wake up call, designed to stop humanity from in-fighting and unite them in one glorious push for the stars. Still others decided that the original attack had been faked, a conspiracy by a hidden world government in order to weaken the individual nations and solidify its position of power.</p>
<p>Of course you should always expect the human race to squabble over the dumbest things. So naturally we should have expected that another war would be unavoidable. And here we are, Humanity’s third great war. It has been long delayed, but also greatly inflated in scale. For the quarrel that would once have scoured the surface of a single planet now rages out of control across the entirety of human-occupied space.</p>
<p>“Yeah captain, thanks for the history lesson, but what’s that got to do with us?”</p>
<p>The ship’s captain smiled grimly. “I’m just wondering if the shot that united us for so long might have come from something as stupid as a gunner failing to double check his firing solution before pulling the trigger 10,000 years ago.”</p>
<p>The crewman flushed as the captain’s point hit home. “I’m sorry sir. It won’t happen again.”</p>
<p>“See that it doesn’t.”</p>
