        <p>“And thus concludes the tale of how Shaaron the Clever fooled the King of the Dragons.” Tolman finished his tale and dismissed his visual aides with a flourish. He bowed to the rote applause of the few remaining patrons, then he collected his tips and stepped down from the stage. Tolman didn’t take it personally. Everyone else in the inn tonight had either gone to bed, or wasn’t paying much attention to the entertainment. It was too late in the evening for that. Tolman surveyed the room as he crossed over to the bar; There were a few drunks already well into their nightly stupors, but what interested him most were the card games already in full swing. There was some serious betting going on tonight.</p>
<p>“I’d like a beer please” Tolman said to the barmaid as he climbed up into a stool by the bar.</p>
<p>“Of course.” She said, as she went to fill the order. When she came back she placed the been in front of him and asked, “How did you do that? The thing with the…” She made a frantic gesture with her hands, clearly not sure how to describe what she meant.</p>
<p>Tolman smiled, he knew what she meant. “You mean the illusions.” Tolman’s former master had claimed to be the first to use illusion magic to augment his storytelling, but Tolman had resolved to perfect it to a point none had ever seen before. In the meantime, however, the tips he earned barely covered his travel expenses between towns; He had to find other ways to turn a profit; he glanced at the card tables. “Took most of my apprenticeship to learn that trick. It’s tricky to get the hang of really, but it’s worth it when it helps the patrons really get involved in the stories.”</p>
<p>Tolman stayed to chat just long enough to be polite to his hostess, his drink was on the house after all. That was one of the perks of being a traveling performer. As the conversation wound down, he finished his beer, ordered another, and clambered down from his barstool to find a place in one of the groups of card players. </p>
<p>Standing at three feet two inches tall, it was hard to command a presence or make a compelling entrance, but Tolman knew just how to make up for it. He dropped a sack containing all of his tips for the evening onto one of the tables. Then he dragged a nearby chair over to his newly claimed spot, and climbed up into it. “Evening gents.” he said as a smile cracked across his face. “What are we playing tonight?” This brought a chuckle around the table, and the dealer started dealing him in.</p>
<p>Tolman hadn’t always been great at cards, but he had always been lucky, so he figured it would be a good skill to learn. You would think with nothing but raw luck on his side that dice would be his game of choice, but the cards gave him a little more control. His luck wasn’t flawless, mostly it just kept him from ending up with a terrible hand. So with a little skill and a little patience, Tolman found he was usually able to take most of the smaller pots, usually just enough to come out a bit ahead at the end of the night.</p>
<p>The barmaid came by with his beer and a Note. “Someone left this for you at the bar.” She said, handing him the note.</p>
<p>“Thank you” he said distractedly, still studying his opponents, he stuffed the note in his pocket. He didn’t want to get distracted now as things were heating up. </p>
<hr>
<p>Much later in the night the common room had cleared of all but four players at Tolman’s table and a couple of dozing drunks. The whole inn was dark save for one candle casting an unsteady light across the faces of the gamblers. Tolman’s betting had brought him well ahead of just breaking even. “What can I say boys? Halflings are just naturally lucky!” Tolman grinned as he raked in the winnings of the latest hand, his fifth win in a row. He had to admit to himself that he was a little dazed by the wealth sitting before him. “Now if you’ll excuse me, the most important lesson I’ve learned while on the road is that it’s best to quit while you’re ahead.”</p>
<p>His companions for the night had insisted on switching to fresh decks twice now, and they had even gone so far as to search Tolman for any extra cards he might be carrying. While they all agreed it didn’t seem likely that he was cheating, the mood at the table was getting too frigid for Tolman’s taste. Now was a good time to leave.</p>
<p>“Luck isn’t everything my little bard friend.” Said the human who was shuffling the cards across the table. Tolman noticed with some irritation that the man had started dealing him in despite what he’d just said about leaving. “Sometimes it’s better to just know the future…”</p>
<p>Tolman scoffed. Sure, there were stories of men who could catch a glimpse of things to come, but if they were real they all lived in palaces far from here. They would have no need to play cards with commoners. “You’re dealing one too many hands, friend.” Tolman said as he continued scooping his winnings into a pouch, preparing to leave.</p>
<p>“Just so happens, that I know I’m going to win this round. I also know that you’re not going to be able to resist this action.” The man said casually as he finished dealing. He didn’t pick up his cards, just left them laying face-down before him. “Here’s how sure I am.” He pushed all of the money he had left in front of him into the the table. The other two remaining gamblers folded immediately, leaving just the mysterious dealer and Tolman. They both got up to go to bed, leaving Tolman alone with the mysterious stranger. “So what’ll it be, Lucky? You going to call?”</p>
<p>The reflection of candle-lit gold glittered in Tolman’s eyes as he estimated the value of the absurd bet. There had to be somewhere around 300 gold pieces in the center of the table, a bet Tolman could match fairly easily. He was up 500 gold over the 20 that he had started with; It had been a good night indeed.</p>
<p>Tolman picked up his hand to consider his odds, then smiled. He had four kings. That would be a tough hand for the stranger to beat, especially without even looking at his cards. Tolman began counting enough coins into the center of the table to match the man’s bet. The stranger smiled at him as he did so. As soon as he was finished placing his coins, Tolman waved his hand, indicating that he wouldn’t need to swap any cards. </p>
<p>The stranger grinned, and without turning any cards over, he casually pushed three cards toward the center and dealt himself three more. Tolman was careful to watch his hands closely for any signs of cheating, but saw none. Then, with a flourish the human flipped over all five of his cards. </p>
<p>“How?” Was all Tolman could manage to whisper as he stared at the straight flush that had just been revealed. The stranger began to scoop all the coins on the table toward himself.</p>
<p>“Like I said little one, I can see the future.”</p>
<p>Tolman decided to ignore the size comment and made a snap decision. “Teach me.”</p>
<p> The man chuckled as he gathered his significant winnings. “I’m no teacher.”</p>
<p>“Who taught you then?” Tolman asked, determined to learn this new skill he didn’t believe in five minutes before.</p>
<p>“I learned it from a book, actually.”</p>
<p>“Name your price.”</p>
<p>The man stopped counting coins and glared down at Tolman. “This is not a decision to be made lightly. Besides, I’m not sure I’m ready to sell it.” He resumed his counting, but his eyes seemed to be looking beyond the coins. “I see two paths before you, Tolman Tosscobble. One, the relative safety of a traveling entertainer, never earning much but always a warm hearth to welcome you. The other, a life of danger! There will be many chances at great rewards, but they will come with dire risks. If you buy this book from me, you will be giving up the safe path in favor of the risky one.”</p>
<p>Tolman didn’t hesitate. He removed another coin purse from his belt, the money he had set aside for travel to his next destination. He added it to what was left of the night’s winnings and pushed the pile across the table. “This is all that I have.” He said sincerely. “Please, sell me the book.”</p>
